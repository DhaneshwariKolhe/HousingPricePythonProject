## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of housing prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, amenities, and location. This analysis provides insights that can help understand the underlying trends in the housing market.

By analyzing the dataset, we have conducted **Univariate**, **Bivariate**, and **Multivariate** analysis and visualized the relationships between different features and their impact on house prices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Data Description

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following features:

- **Price**: The price of the house.
- **Area**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **Rooms**: The number of rooms in the house.
- **Amenities**: Whether the house has amenities (yes/no).
- **Furnished**: Whether the house is furnished (yes/no).
- **Preferred Area**: Whether the house is located in a preferred area.
- **Location**: The geographical location of the house.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data using summary statistics and visualizations.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, incorrect data types, and data inconsistencies.
- **Visualization**: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations like:
  - Scatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and more.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Studying one variable at a time.
- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**: Studying relationships between two or more variables.
- **Insights**: Providing insights into what features drive housing prices.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhaneshwariKolhe/HousingPricePythonProject.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd HousingPricePythonProject
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook housingpricedata-dhaneshwari.ipynb
```

4. Explore the analysis and visualizations in the notebook.

## Results

Through this analysis, we were able to identify key factors that influence house prices such as:

- The location and area of the house have a significant impact on price.
- Houses located in preferred areas are more expensive on average.
- The number of rooms and the availability of amenities also affect house prices.
